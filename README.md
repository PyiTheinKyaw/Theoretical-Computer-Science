# Theoretical-Computer-Science and Cryptography
This repo is my study note while learning about Basic Math for Computer Science.

- Modular arithemtic
- Algorithm & Theorm
    - [Euclidean algorithm](/i1_Algorithm_Theorem/i1_divisibility_euclidean_algorithm.html)
        - which is used to find GCD or HCF.
    - Extened Eculidean algorithm (EEA)
        - finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. This EEA have been used in "Bezout Identity" to find a,b and also used to find GCD and MI.
    - Bezout Identity (In progress)
    - Chinese reminder theorm (CRI)
        - The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is used to solve a set of different congruent equations with one variable ***BUT different moduli which are relatively prime***
