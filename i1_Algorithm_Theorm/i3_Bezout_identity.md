**What's Bezout's Identity?**

Bezout's identity for non-zero integers a, b let d = GCD(a,b) then there exists integers x,y such that:

$$
ax + by = d
$$

$x,y$ is bezout coefficien and we can simplify above equation into:

$$
ax + by = gcd(a, b)
$$

***Example:***

$GCD(4,16) = 4$

so, let $a = 4, b = 16$,

$ax + by = gcd(a,b)$

$4x + 16y = 4$


There are many value to solve this equation as below.

$4.(5) + 16(-1) = 4$

$4.(1) + 16(0) = 4$

{5,-1}, {1,0} those bezout coefficient are solved above equation.
