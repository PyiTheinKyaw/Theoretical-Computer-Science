# One Time Pad (OTP)

One Time Pad (OTP) is unconditional sercure which means unconditional security is based on information theory and assumes no limit on
the attackerâ€™s computational power.

Here is the defination of "**One-Time Pad (OTP)**" - 

1. the key stream $s_0, s_1, s_2, \ldots$ is generated by a **true random number generator(TRNG)** and
2. the key stream is only known to the legitimate communicating parties, and
3. every key stream bit $s_i$ is only used once

is called a one-time pad. The one-time pad is unconditionally secure.

It is easy to show why the OTP is unconditionally secure. Here is a sketch of a
proof. For every ciphertext bit we get an equation of this form:

$y_0 \cong x_0 + s_0 \pmod{2}$

$y_1 \cong x_1 + s_1 \pmod{2}$

...

Each individual **relation is a linear equation modulo 2 with two unknowns**. They are impossible to solve. 

If the attacker knows the value for $y_0$ (0 or 1), he cannot determine the value of $x_0$. In fact, the solutions $x_0 = 0$ and $x_0 = 1$ are exactly equally likely if $s_0$ stems from a truly random source and there is 50% chance that it has the value 0 and 1. The situation is identical for the second equation and all subsequent ones.
