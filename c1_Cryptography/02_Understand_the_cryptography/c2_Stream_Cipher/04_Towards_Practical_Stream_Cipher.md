# Towards Practical Stream Cipher

In OTP, it's discuss about the concept of unconditionally secure, but the drawback of "Unconditionally secure" is impractical.

Stream ciphers used in the real world, it should be stressed that practical stream ciphers are not unconditionally secure.

In fact, all known practical crypto algorithms (stream ciphers, block ciphers, public-key algorithms) are not **unconditionally secure**. The best we can hope for is **computational security**.
