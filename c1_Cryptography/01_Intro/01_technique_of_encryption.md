# Technique of Encryption

There are two classical technique of Encryption. Those encryption technique are no longer use in this modern encryption.

1) Substituation Technique
2) Transposition Technique

### Substituation Technique

In this technique, letters are replaced by other letters or symbols. For example:
a into x, b into l, something like that.

### Transposition Technique
This technique is all about applying some sort of **permutation** on the plaintext letter.

For example:

Plain text: NESO,

Cipher text: ESON, SONE, ONES, ENOS,...

### Some Algorithm that use above technique
